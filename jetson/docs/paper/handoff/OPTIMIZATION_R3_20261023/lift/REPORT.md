# Round 3 sandbox development experiments — lift

Development screen only; no method selected or promoted. Frozen sources and K34 are unchanged.
All intervals: paired unit bootstrap, 2,000, seed 0; pointwise, exploratory. No GPU wall time is a Jetson latency measurement.
G retains the original K30 cost convention (jerk relative to previous cheap action).
Every executed policy/refiner row is retained. Logical requested pixels, not Jetson padded pixels.
Generic-component/equal-total-budget controls remain necessary before a selector-superiority claim.

Every executed row and its interval is retained in summary.csv, intervals.csv and contrasts.csv.
Severity/episode details: episodes.csv. Mechanism counts overlap and are not causal fractions: diagnostics.csv.
No latency, deployment, or confirmatory-test conclusion is supported by this development screen. Smoke units were selected diagnostic cases, not an unbiased quality sample.
